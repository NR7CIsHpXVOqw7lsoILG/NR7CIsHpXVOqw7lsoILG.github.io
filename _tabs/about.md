This site was created with the intent to warn other Christians about the spiritual dangers of Evangel Bible Church of Berkeley. It is the culmination of several other unsuccessful attempts to sound the alarm about this church via various other social platforms such as Google, Yelp, Reddit, and Facebook. Unfortunately most of the posts to these centralized platforms get censored pretty quickly due to supposed violation of the platforms' "Community Service". The speed and efficacy of the censorship efforts are such that it is almost certain that the pastors of EBCB (John and Nancy Shim) are using some sort of online reputation defender service to automate the takedown process. This obsessive image protecting behavior makes this site all the more necessary.
