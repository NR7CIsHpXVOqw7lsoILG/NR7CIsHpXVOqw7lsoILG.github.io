Much can be said about Evangel Bible Church of Berkeley, from the monotonous fearmongering about religious unbelievers, the constant veneration of ‘teachability’ and the dishonest bait-and-switch evangelism tactics. However, all these issues pale in comparison to the most significant problem with this church which is that the pastor and his wife and daughter all routinely lie, manipulate, gaslight, and abuse their members whom they seek to control. John, Nancy, and Abigale are completely different people behind closed doors and sadly many members are completely clueless about this until it's their turn to close the door and have a seat. Members can attend this church for years without having a clue about the amount of spiritual abuse being commited from behind these closed doors. 

Churches across the Bay Area and beyond are littered with refugees from this church. Some are extremely vocal about the dangers of this church while others are more reluctant to talk about their experiences, the latter usually claiming that they are trusting in the sovereignty of God to bring justice to this pastor and his wife. It is the opinion of this writer that man ought to exercise the abilities that God has given him to act righteously in this world and rather entrust those things beyond his ability to control to God.

The church is a real hazard for young, naive christian students at UC Berkeley who enroll in the university each year looking for a solid, Bible-believing church with expository, verse-by-verse teaching that they can attend during their 4 years at UC Berkeley. Many of these students will hear about GracePoint Church since it has a large presence on campus. Some of these students may be fortunate enough to learn of it's infamous reputation and seek a more reputable church to attend. This is usually when folks find EBCB. Each year (like clockwork) a fresh batch of students from UC Berkely joins the church, hoping to hear solid expository preaching from the Bible and a good family of believers they can fellowship with while in school. Sadly, what far too many often get instead is false accusations, lying, shaming, gaslighting and manipulation. To be sure, not everyone is subjected to this treatment, and not always right away. Sometimes it takes people 8+ years to see this side of the pastor and/or his wife. In these situations, the impact that the spiritual abuse can last for years.

While each story of abuse is unique, there are some common threads that can be observed in each story. The all-too-common pattern of abuse usually follows the following sequence of events

1. Certain indivituals who pose some perceived threat to the leaders agenda are targeted and asked to attend a meeting.

2. Accusations of gossip, slander, or certain unobservable heart conditions (such as anger or jealousy) are made.
    
3. If the targeted individual attempts to defend themselves from scripture, scripture is twisted to support the leadership's claims and then the individual's argument is discounted because the true interpretation of any given text is only discernible from the original Greek translation.
    
4. Depending on how the accused individual responds, they are either gaslight them into making a public confession, or the accusations are shared with the church and the rest of the members of the church are encouraged to apply pressure on the individual until they capitulates and confess to the false accusations or they leave the church in disgrace.

These tactics have resulted in pitting roommates against roommates, friends against friends, brother against brother, sister against sister, and perhaps most tragically, even husbands against wives.

Over the years, the pastor has been confronted by various former members and leaders alike, but each time, the pastor and his wife have managed to maintain control of the narrative and refused to repent in any meaningful or lasting way. Any claims of 'plurality of leadership' are completely false. Multiple former elders have confronted the pastor in the past and they were immediately ousted. The current set of leaders are a carefully groomed set of spineless sycophants. Each and every single member who remained through the 2018 drama is complicit in supporting the rampant spiritual abuse that continues at this church.

It's a sad legacy of abuse that this pastor, his wife, and now more recently even his daughter Abby have created for themselves. Any guess as to why the pastor and his wife have chosen this path of self-service would be pure speculation and I will not be so arrogant as to venture a guess. God only knows. My guess is that this whole sad saga will only come to a final end when one of the pastor's children wisens up and blows the final whistle on their parents.
