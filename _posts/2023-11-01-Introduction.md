# Introduction
This site is the culmination of several other unsuccessful attempts to warn other Christians about the spiritual dangers of Evangel Bible Church of Berkeley. Over the years, many reviews highlighting the harmful practices of the pastor of this church have been posted to various other social platforms such as Google, Yelp, Reddit, and Facebook, but most of them get censored pretty quickly due to supposed violation of the platforms' Terms of Service. The speed and efficacy of the censorship efforts are such that it is almost certain that the pastor is using some sort of online reputation defender service to automate the takedown process.

Much can be said about this church, from the constant fear mongering about religious unbelievers, the unhealthy veneration of ‘teachability’ and the dishonest, bait-and-switch evangelism tactics, however, all these issues pale in comparison to the most significant problem with this church which is that the pastor and his wife and daughter all routinely lie, manipulate, gaslight, and abuse their members whom they seek to control. Members can attend this church for years without having a clue about the amount of spiritual abuse being commited from behind closed doors.

Churches across the state are littered with refugees from this church. Some are extremely reluctant to talk about their experiences, claiming that they are trusting in the sovereignty of God to bring justice to this pastor and his wife. It is the opinion of this writer that man ought to exercise the abilities that God has given him to act righteously in this world and entrust those things beyond his ability to control to God. Hence, this letter.

The church is a real hazard for young, naive christian students at UC Berkeley who enroll in the university each year looking for a solid, Bible-believing church with expository, verse-by-verse teaching that they can attend during their 4 years at UCB. Many of these students will hear about GracePoint Church since it has a large presence on campus. Some of these students may be fortunate enough to learn of it's atrocious reputation and seek a more reputable church to attend. This is usually when folks find EBCB. They show up expecting expository, verse-by-verse Bible teaching and fellowship with other like-minded believers. Unfortunately what many get instead is lies, manipulation, gaslighting, bullying, interrogation, and peer pressure from other naive members.

The following is the general pattern of abuse that has been derived from the various stories shared by numerous former members.

1. An individual is targeted because they are somehow contrary to the pastor's (or his wife's) agenda for thier church.
2. Accusations of gossip, slander, anger, jealousy, arrogance, bitterness, or other non-observable heart conditions are made agains the individual.
3. Lies, manipulation, gaslighting, and interrogation tactics are used to pressure the individual to capitulate to the pastor's (or his family's) demands.
4. If the individual uses scripture to push back, the pastor retreats to some minute detail of some bibilical passage that is only discernible via the original Greek text (which of course nobody can compete with).
5. If the individual has still not capitualted by this point, follow step 3 of church discipline outlined in Matthew 18 and leverage the rest of the body to exhert social pressure on the individual to repent. 
6. If the indivitual has not capitulated or left the church by this point, then they are excommunicated.

The tactics listed above have pitted roommate against roommate, friend against friend, brother against brother, sister against sister, and perhaps most tragically in some cases, husband against wife.

Any claims of 'plurality of leadership' are completely false. Numerous cohorts of members and leaders alike have attempted to confront the pastor and/or his wife over the years. Each attempt has been unsuccessful in effecting any meaningful or lasting repentence whatsoever. Any leader or respected member who challenges this pastor or his wife is promptly dismissed/excommunicated. The current leaders are a carefully groomed set of spineless syncophants who have been complicit in decades of spiritual abuse.

It's a sad legacy of abuse that this pastor and his wife have created for themselves. Any guess as to why the pastor and his wife have chosen this path of self-service would be pure speculation and I will not be so arrogant as to venture a guess. God only knows. My guess is that this whole sad saga will only come to a final end when one of the pastor's children wisens up and blows the final whistle on their parents.
