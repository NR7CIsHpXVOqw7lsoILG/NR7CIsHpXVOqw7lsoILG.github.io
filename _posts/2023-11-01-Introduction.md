# Introduction
This site was created with the intent to warn other Christians about the spiritual dangers of Evangel Bible Church of Berkeley. It is the culmination of several other unsuccessful attempts to sound the alarm about this church via various other social platforms such as Google, Yelp, Reddit, and Facebook, but most of them get censored pretty quickly due to supposed violation of the platforms' "Terms of Service". The speed and efficacy of the censorship efforts are such that it is almost certain that the pastors of EBCB (John and Nancy Shim) are using some sort of online reputation defender service to automate the takedown process. This obsessive image protecting behavior makes this site all the more necessary.

Much can be said about this church, from the constant fear mongering about religious unbelievers, the unhealthy veneration of ‘teachability’ and the dishonest, bait-and-switch evangelism tactics, however, all these issues pale in comparison to the most significant problem with this church which is that the pastor and his wife and daughter all routinely lie, manipulate, gaslight, and abuse their members whom they seek to control. Members can attend this church for years without having a clue about the amount of spiritual abuse being commited from behind closed doors.

Churches across the state are littered with refugees from this church. Some are extremely reluctant to talk about their experiences, claiming that they are trusting in the sovereignty of God to bring justice to this pastor and his wife. It is the opinion of this writer that man ought to exercise the abilities that God has given him to act righteously in this world and entrust those things beyond his ability to control to God. Hence, this letter.

The church is a real hazard for young, naive christian students at UC Berkeley who enroll in the university each year looking for a solid, Bible-believing church with expository, verse-by-verse teaching that they can attend during their 4 years at UCB. Many of these students will hear about GracePoint Church since it has a large presence on campus. Some of these students may be fortunate enough to learn of it's atrocious reputation and seek a more reputable church to attend. This is usually when folks find EBCB. Each year a fresh batch of students join the church, hoping to find solid expository preaching and a good family of believers they can fellowship with but sadly, what many often get instead is false accusations, lying, shaming, gaslighting and manipulation. To be sure, only a select few get subjected to this treatment, but for those who do, it damages them for years after.

While each case is somewhat unique, there are some common threads that are worth enumerating here. The following is the pattern that has been derived from the various stories shared by numerous former members.

1. Identify individuals who pose some perceived threat to the leaders agenda.

2. Make accusations of gossip, slander, or certain unobservable heart conditions (such as anger or jealousy).
    
3. If the accused attempts to defend themselves from scripture, twist the scripture to fit their needs and then claim higher knowledge of the scripture because the basis of their interpretation is only discernible from the original Greek translation.
    
4. Depending on how the accused individual responds, either gaslight them into making a public confession or follow step 3 of church discipline and use the rest of the members of the church to pressure until the accused capitulates and confesses to the false accusations or leaves the church in disgrace.

These tactics often result in dividing roommates against roommates, friends against friends, brother against brother, sister against sister, and perhaps most tragically, even husbands against wives.

Over the years, the pastor has been confronted by various former members and leaders alike, but each time, the pastor and his wife have managed to maintain control of the narrative and refused to repent in any meaningful or lasting way. Any claims of 'plurality of leadership' are completely false. Multiple former elders have confronted the pastor in the past and they were immediately ousted. The current set of leaders are a carefully groomed set of spineless sycophants. Each and every single member who remained through the 2018 drama is complicit in supporting the rampant spiritual abuse that continues at this church.

It's a sad legacy of abuse that this pastor and his wife have created for themselves. Any guess as to why the pastor and his wife have chosen this path of self-service would be pure speculation and I will not be so arrogant as to venture a guess. God only knows. My guess is that this whole sad saga will only come to a final end when one of the pastor's children wisens up and blows the final whistle on their parents.
