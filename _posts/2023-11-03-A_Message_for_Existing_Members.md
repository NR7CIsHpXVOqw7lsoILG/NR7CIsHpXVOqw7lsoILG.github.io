Many years ago, I once asked a member of this church: "If I had proof that John Shim is bold-faced lying to the body, would you want to see it?".
His answer: "No."

Brothers and sisters, this unquestioning loyalty to a leader is incredibly dangerous. This mindset is the fertil ground out of which cults are born. 

If you are a current member, I offer the following words of advice:

1. Pray fervently to the Lord for the truth to be revealed to you and to the rest of the body.
2. Read "Talking to Strangers" by Malcolm Gladwell. Pay close attention to discussion re: Timothy R. Levine's Truth-Default Theory and consider how it might apply to this situation.
3. Seek outside help to help you make sense of your situation. Reach out to an unaffiliated pastor that you have known a long time and trust. The practices of this church are wrong in ways that are hard to see from within, but are more apparent when viewed from an outsider's perspective.

This list may grow over the coming weeks and months.

Stay tuned.
